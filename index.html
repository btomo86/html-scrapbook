    <p>Example of an ordered list<strong> (How to make a brew like a proper Yorkshireman)</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Run the tap a little so the water's nicely aertated, and only boil it once to keep the oxygen level up. Oxygen in water helps flavour!</li>
        <li>Pop a tea bag into a mug, pour over hot water and stir briefly</li>
        <li>Tea needs time to unlock all its flavour, so give it 4-5 minutes to do its thing. This is perfect time to munch a sneaky biscuit or daydream about holidays</li>
        <li>Before removing the tea bag, gently squidge it against the side of the mug. Just the once.</li>
        <li>I like a splash of semi-skimmed milk, but your brew is unique to you- so add milk, sugar, honey or nothing at all. Most importantly, enjoy!</li>
